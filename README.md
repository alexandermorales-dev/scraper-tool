# Scraper Tool - For Real State website (Capstone Project)

> This tool allows the user to find a target in a given website. The tool was created with the concept of Leads Generation in mind, therefore, it should be able to provide the desired information to the user. In this case, the tool will search for Property Names, Price, Location, and Contact Info by area.

In order to achieve this, Nokogiri gem needs to be used so we can actually get the functionality of scraping and just modify the parameters for the queries as needed.

## Built With

- Ruby
- Nokogiri gem
- RSpec for testing
- Rubocop for better quality code 

## Getting Started

**To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.**

- Clone this repository to a local folder
- In this case the main file `scraper.rb` is in the root folder, so there's no need to `cd` into any other folder.
- In your text editor's terminal run the command `ruby scraper.rb`

### Prerequisites

- Text editor
- Ruby >= 2.5

- In the variable `html` you should change the url for the page that you want to scrape.
