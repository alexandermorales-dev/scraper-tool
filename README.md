# Scraper Tool - For Real State website (Capstone Project)

> This tool allows the user to find a target in a given website. The tool was created with the concept of Leads Generation in mind, but it can be used for different purposes, for example, getting a list of prices from a website, getting email contacts, relevant positions from a company website, etc. In this case, after giving the proper URL to the tool, it will search for Property Names, Price, and revert with Average price for the given location long witha list of each property and price.

In order to achieve this, Nokogiri gem needs to be used so we can actually get the functionality of scraping and just modify the parameters for the queries as needed.
